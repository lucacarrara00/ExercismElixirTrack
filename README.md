# Exercism Elixir Exercises

Here you can find all the solutions for the Elixir track exercises on Exercism.

Each exercise has it's own directory. In each directory there are two files:

- `README.md` which contains the instructions in order to complete different tasks;
- `N_ExerciseName.ex`, where N stand for the exercise number based on the [overview order](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir), which contains the solution.

> _N.B. Some exercises instructions might be outdated since they are under continue development/fix!_
